# A Data-Driven Look at Why Lily Allen’s *West End Girl* Works So Well

When I first listened to Lily Allen’s new album, *West End Girl*, shortly after its release, I found myself completely absorbed. I stopped everything I was doing and listened to the whole thing start to finish, not because I planned to, but because I couldn’t pull myself away.

It felt less like an album and more like an audiobook: the storytelling was vivid, the structure was intentional, and every track pulled the narrative forward. The funny part is that I don’t even have a favorite song. I can’t listen to it in pieces - it’s all or nothing.

After looping the album more times than I’d like to admit, I decided to channel this obsession into something productive:
**Was my experience unique, or does the data support what I felt?**
And while I was at it - why not practice a bit of API work?

In this project, I use Spotify’s public Web API to extract data on recent album releases, explore the relationship between an artist’s popularity, their follower count, and the performance of their newest album, and finally take a deeper look at *West End Girl* as a case study.

The goal was simple: combine a little curiosity, a lot of music, and some data skills - and see what story the numbers tell.
